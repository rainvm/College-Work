\begin{example}
    We would like to show that the sequence
    \begin{equation*}
        w_k(x) = \begin{cases}
            k, &  0<x<\frac{1}{k}\\
            0, &x\leq 0 \text{ and } x \geq \frac{1}{k}
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    is a \(\d\)-sequence using theorem (\ref{th:assertion}). It is clear that \(w_k(x)\geq 0\)  for all \(x\) and \(w(x)=O(1/x^{1+\a})\) as \(|x| \rightarrow \inf\) with \(\a>0\) since it is zero when \(\leq 0\) or \(x \geq 1/k\). Lastly, we must show that the area under \(w(x)\) is 1. Choosing \(w(x)\) so that \(kw(kx)=w_k(x)\)
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{split}
            \intR w(x) dx &= \int_{-\inf}^{0} 0 dx +\int_0^1 1 dx + \int_{1}^{\inf} 0 dx\\
            &=\int_0^1 1 dx\\
            &=1
        \end{split}
    \end{equation}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    We would like to show that the sequence
    \begin{equation}
        w_k(x) = \begin{cases}
            -k, &|x|<\frac{1}{2k}\\
            2k, &\frac{1}{2k} \leq |x| \leq \frac{1}{k}\\
            0, &|x|> \frac{1}{k} 
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    is a delta sequence. Theorem (\ref{th:assertion}) does not apply in this case becuase \(w_k(x)\) is negative for some values of \(x\). %TODO continue
