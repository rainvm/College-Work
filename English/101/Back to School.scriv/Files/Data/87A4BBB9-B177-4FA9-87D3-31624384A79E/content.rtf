I had just graduated from high school and was working as a sales associate at Staples in Bedford, NH, but did not know what was next. I had always planned on going to college after high school but I was a poor student and didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t even finish applying to schools.
