In sixth grade I stopped turning in some homework assignments and in Eight grade I failed my first class. Things did not get better throughout high school and by my senior year I was late almost every day and had failed several classes in previous years. I managed to graduate only by the skin of my teeth. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 I still loved learning, Math and Physics were my favorite, but I have interests in every field. I wanted to go to college but I knew it was not realistic and I would most likely continue to do poorly, so I didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t apply. Instead I continued working in retail at Staples and I hated it. I found it menial, demeaning, and frankly, beneath me. I eventually had a breakdown before work and quit on the spot. }}
