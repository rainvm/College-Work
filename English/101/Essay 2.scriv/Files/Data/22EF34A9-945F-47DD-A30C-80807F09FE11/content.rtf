In the scene, Louise\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s daughter asks her for a word that refers to a situation in which both sides of an interaction can have a positive outcome. Louise can\u8217\'92t remember the word and her daughter says that her father would know (124). A few pages later, the physicist that Louise has been working with says the phrase, \u8220\'93non-zero-sum game\u8221\'94, and the narrative returns to the point that the scene where her daughter asked about the word ended and Louise says \u8220\'93non-zero-sum game\u8221\'94 (127). This scene in particular is useful for both mediums, because it illustrates Louise\u8217\'92s experience with time using a short phrase that many people have heard before. Because the phrase is short and memorable, it is easy to convey in both without losing the audience\u8217\'92s attention. It also uses a simple question to keep the first part of the scene in the their minds while waiting for the second part. }}
