\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The original novella is narrated in the first person by Dr. Louise Banks, a linguist who is asked by the military to help translate the language of aliens that have recently come to earth. The aliens have a nonlinear language and as Louise gains an increasing understanding of it, she begins to remember events of her life that have not happened yet, which seems to be similar to the way that the aliens see the world. }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 Arrival}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  also follows Dr. Banks along a similar storyline.}}
