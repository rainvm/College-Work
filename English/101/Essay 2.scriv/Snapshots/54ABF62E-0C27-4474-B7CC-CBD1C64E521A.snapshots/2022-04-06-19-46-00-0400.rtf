In the movie the aliens are enormous creatures shrouded in mist that seem to have mysterious powers, such as their ability to expel some sort of ink that hangs in the air and can display words in their language. In the novella their size is not known because the characters are seeing them through something analogous to a video call and can only know their size relative to their environment. The aliens also are not in an empty environment filled with mist and instead Louise talks about seeing them entering and exiting through a door, they communicate in their written language using something that seems similar to a computer, and she even sees them eating. Louise also describes conversations with them in more depth than is shown in the movie. This all works together makes the aliens in }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 Story of Your Life}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  feel much more human than those in }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 Arrival}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 .}}
