        <Text>There is one scene in Arrival that is lifted almost word for word from Story of Your Life. In the scene, Louise’s daughter asks her for a word that refers to a situation in which both sides of an interaction can have a positive outcome. Louise can’t remember the word and her daughter says that her father would know. A few pages later, the physicist that Louise has been working with says the phrase, “non-zero-sum game”, and the narrative returns to the point that the scene where her daughter asked about the word ended and Louise says “non-zero-sum game”. It is interesting that this scene so identical in the movie because there aren’t other scenes that are so similar.</Text>
