        <Text>Arrival follows the same general plot and has similar themes to Story of Your Life but the way that the two are presented to the audience is vastly different. Story of Your Life is a dense, low stakes, story that some readers may have difficulty understanding, and while Arrival is still cerebral it can be enjoyed without understanding some of the more complex ideas that it presents, and as such is likely more palatable for most people. </Text>
