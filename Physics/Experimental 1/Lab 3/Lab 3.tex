\section{Introduction}
In this lab, we analyzed a low pass filter, a high pass filter, and an RLC circuit using the Analog Discovery 2. 

\section{Measuring Capacitance}
We built a low pass filter circuit (Figure 1) with the oscilloscope of the AD 2 monitoring the input and output voltages. Using the impedance function in the Waveforms software we measured the series capacitance of the capacitor, C1. We measured 3 capacitors. One was reported to be 100 nF. The second was reported to be 10 nF. The last was reported to be 1 \(\mu\)F. In the diagram, R1 is 10 k\O for the 100 nF capacitor, 100 k\O for the 10 nF capacitor, and 1 k\O for the 1 \(\mu\)F capacitor. We also measured the capacitances using the Mastech MS8268 Multi-Meter. The capacitances were 90.6 nF, 9.2 nF, and 1.13 nF respectively.

We conclude that the reported capacitance values of the capacitors are not accurate. The measurements made by the Active Discovery 2 and the multimeter are fairly close. I trust the measurements made by the active discovery more because it reports the capacitance for a particular frequency while the multimeter does not.

\section{Low Pass Filter}
In this part of the lab, we continue to use the previous circuit (Figure 1), with R1=10 k\O\ and C1=100 nF. We sent a square wave from the wave generator through the filter and used the oscilloscope channel 1 to record the input voltage and channel 2 to record the output voltage. The fall time as determined by the AD 2 was 1.87 \(\mu\)s and the rise time as determined by the AD 2 was 1.07 \(\mu\)s
